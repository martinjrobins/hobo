# What is Pints?

We are working on problems in the area of inverse modelling and baysian 
inference as applied to problems in electrochemistry and cardiac 
electrophysiology. Pints (Probabilistic Inference on Noisy Time-Series) 
is a collaborative repository to organise our efforts and share tools.

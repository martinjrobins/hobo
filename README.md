# What is Pints?

Pints (Probabilistic Inference on Noisy Time-Series) is a framework for optimisation and bayesian inference problems with ODE models of noisy time-series, such as arise in electrochemistry and cardiac electrophysiology.


## How do I use pints?

To use a model in Pints, you need to make sure it extends the [ForwardModel](http://pints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_classes_and_methods.html#forward-model) interface, which has just two methods:

```
n_parameters() --> Returns the dimension of the parameter space.
        
simulate(parameters, times) --> Returns a vector of model evaluations at
                                the given times, using the given parameters
```

If your model implements these methods - [or you can write a wrapper class that does](examples/writing-a-model.ipynb) - you can start using Pints for [optimisation](examples/optimisation-first-example.ipynb) or [MCMC](examples/inference-first-example.ipynb).

### Examples and documentation

Pints comes with a number of [detailed examples](examples/EXAMPLES.md), hosted here on github. In addition, there is a [full API documentation](http://pints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), hosted on readthedocs.io.

## How can I install Pints?

You'll need the following requirements:

- Python 2.7 or Python 3.4+
- Python libraries: `cma` `numpy` `matplotlib` `scipy`

These will be installed automatically if you go to the directory you downloaded pints to, and run

```
$ pip install .
```

Or, if you want to install Pints as a [developer](CONTRIBUTING.md), use

```
$ pip install -e .[dev,docs]
```

To uninstall again, type

```
$ pip uninstall pints
```

## How can I contribute to Pints?

If you'd like to help us develop Pints by adding new methods, writing documentation, or fixing embarassing bugs, please have a look at these [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

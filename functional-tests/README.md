# Functional testing

This directory contains the functional tests.

Unlike the unit tests, these tests are _not_ part of the `pints` module, and
they won't be installed via pypi/pip.

I even imagine this directory (or the results subdirectory?) might be a
submodule, so that test results etc. live in their own repository.

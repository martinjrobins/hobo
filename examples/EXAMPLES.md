# Examples

This page contains a number of examples showing how to use Pints.

Each example was created as a _Jupyter notebook_ (http://jupyter.org/).
These notebooks can be downloaded and used, or you can simply copy/paste the
relevant code!

The examples have been ordered in categories.
Each categoy starts off with a detailed first example, followed by a number of
"recipe" examples that can be copy/pasted to quickly use Pints on your problem
of choice.

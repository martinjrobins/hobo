Myokit installer for GNOME/KDE
------------------------------
This directory contains a script for GNOME/DKE environments that can install a
desktop icon for myokit, register a mime-type for .mmt files and create a
syntax highlighting file for gtksourceview based applications (i.e. gedit).
For instructions, simply run the installer without any command line arguments.

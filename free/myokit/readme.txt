Myokit quick-start guide
========================

To quickly test if myokit is running, open a terminal or command window,
navigate to the myokit directory and type

    python myo run example
    
To open an IDE window, type

    python myo
    
To see what else the "myo" script can do, type

    python myo -h

Gnome/KDE
---------
If you're a Gnome or KDE user, you may wish to install a Myokit icon to your
menu, add the mime-type information for myokit mmt files or add syntax
highlighting for gtksourceview (gedit). Scripts to do this are located in
    
    ./about/gnome-kde
